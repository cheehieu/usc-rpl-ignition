## Overview
Rockets can be dangerous. And the bigger the rocket, the greater the hazards. This ignition system project was designed to improve safety, usability, and reliability on the existing RPL launch controller. It allows the team to launch from a safe distance (under the cover of a bunker), test for connection continuity, and avoid a premature ignition.

The design was inspired by a launch controller built by the rocket team [vatsaas](http://www.vatsaas.org/RTV/Support/relay/launcher.aspx). The core functionality is similar, but optimizations were made to improve portability and reuse.

## Hardware
The schematic from the rocket team vatsaas is illustrated below. Changes to this design include: 
* Rechargable LiPo battery 30A

* mechanical features (key lock switch, protection, carrying case)
* electrical features (LiPo battery, relay, buzzer, RJ11 cable, continuity check)
